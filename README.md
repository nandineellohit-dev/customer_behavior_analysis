# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
A data analysis project focused on understanding customer behavior using real-world-style datasets. This project includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, trend identification, segmentation, and actionable insights on purchasing patterns. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to highlight key drivers behind customer decisions.
📌 Overview

This project provides an end-to-end analysis of customer shopping behaviour using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The workflow includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, SQL-based business queries, dashboard creation, and a final presentation summarizing insights.

The project demonstrates practical data analytics skills across multiple tools and is structured to be clear, reproducible, and recruiter-friendly.

📂 Project Files

customer_shopping_behavior.csv - Raw dataset used for the analysis
Customer_shopping_behaviour_analysis.ipynb	- Python notebook for loading data, EDA, and cleaning
Customer_Database.sql - 	SQL queries executed on PostgreSQL for deeper insights

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information such as:

Demographics (age group, gender, subscription status)

Purchase amount, item purchased, category

Shipping type, discount usage

Review ratings

Previous purchases

It allows exploration of behavior patterns, spending trends, and customer segmentation.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

PostgreSQL + SQL

Power BI

PowerPoint for final presentation

🔍 Steps in the Project
1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration (Python)

Loaded the CSV dataset into a Jupyter Notebook

Inspected structure, column types, missing values, and distributions

Generated initial descriptive statistics

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized key patterns such as:

Popular product categories

Spending patterns by gender/age group

Discount behaviour

Shipping type preferences

Identified trends and anomalies

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Standardized categorical values

Transformed review ratings and created additional segments if needed

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

The SQL script includes business-driven queries such as:

Revenue comparison between genders

Identifying high-value discount users

Top-rated products

Shipping type performance

Subscriber vs non-subscriber revenue

Most discounted products

Customer segmentation (new, returning, loyal)

Category-wise top products

Repeat buyers vs subscription likelihood

Age-group revenue contribution

All queries are stored in Customer_Database.sql 

Customer_Database

.

5. Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built in Customer_Representation.pbix, highlighting:

Total revenue & KPIs

Customer demographics

Purchase behaviour breakdown

Category-wise performance

Discount vs non-discount behaviour

Subscription insights

6. Final Report / Presentation

A concise PPT summarizes:

Key findings

Visual insights

Business implications

Recommendations

📈 Key Insights

Some insights revealed through the analysis:

Revenue distribution varies significantly across age groups and genders

Discounts influence buying behavior, but some customers spend above average even with discounts

Subscribers tend to generate higher average revenue

Certain product categories dominate purchases

Loyal customers (with more than 10 previous purchases) contribute a major chunk of revenue

(You can add more specific insights based on your final results.)
